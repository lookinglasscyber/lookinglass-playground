# Lookinglass Cyber LLC

## Purpose

Lookinglass Cyber LLC is Freddy Aybar’s cybersecurity and AI consulting business.

The goal of this project is to use this folder as the **brain** for:

- Service offerings and packaging.
- Client opportunities and proposals.
- Internal processes, SOPs, and playbooks.
- Long-term strategy and experiments.

## Outcomes

- A small, clearly defined menu of services Freddy can deliver confidently.
- Reusable templates for proposals, SOWs, and onboarding.
- A simple pipeline view of current and potential clients.
- Clear separation between:
  - Work done for Excensure (MSP role).
  - Work done under Lookinglass Cyber LLC (his own business).

## Context

- Freddy currently works at Excensure for a major financial client.
- Lookinglass is intended to be a complementary business, not a conflict.
- The business will likely integrate:
  - Intune / endpoint expertise.
  - Cybersecurity consulting and assessments.
  - AI-assisted workflows and tooling.
